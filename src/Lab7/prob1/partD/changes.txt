- Equals method: Updated the signature to override equals(Object) properly and added null checks.
- HashCode method: Implemented the hashCode() method in line with the equals() method.
- Inclusion of 'visited': Removed visited from the equals and hashCode logic, as it should not be used for duplicate detection.
- Safety checks: In removeDuplicates(), avoided assuming a non-empty list when accessing elements.
